        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from

        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
